In this, user has to firstly register, then login. After logging in, user has to play in 5 successive rounds. each round has a different and intriguing challenge, one wrong answer and pffttt.... re-spawned from the first level.
### If a user attempts to reload the page or if he logs in after leaving the game in the middle of a level, the game resumes from where the user left it last time. The state(current level,current score and high score) of a user is always saved.

In this, various soft skills assessed are:

## Technical information:

Frontend is based on ReactJs. Backend is in Nodejs, database used is MongoDB. Have also used ExpressJs,Mongoose ODM library,concurrently,express-session etc.

## Setting up:
Clone the repo, run yarn install in the frontend i.e. treasure-app. Then, navigate to backend directory i.e. treasure-backend and run npm install. Ensure MongoDB is installed and running(Refer to mongodb guide for the OS of your system)
